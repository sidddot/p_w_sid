            Developed an AI-based facial recognition system using computer vision to analyze and identify facial landmarks and features of people entering the homes of visually impaired individuals, delivering precise and reliable results. The system's doorstep camera detects visitors and alerts the visually impaired, promoting independence and enhancing safety by reducing crime. Integrated the Dlib library to achieve a remarkable efficiency rate of 99.38%, significantly enhancing the system's accuracy and efficiency.
